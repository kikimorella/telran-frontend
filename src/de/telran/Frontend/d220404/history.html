            The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the
            '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to
            either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal
            system.

            Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch
            of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be
            disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research
            Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was
            a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with
            the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.

            January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer
            networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was
            established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of
            computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed
            to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected
            by a universal language.
